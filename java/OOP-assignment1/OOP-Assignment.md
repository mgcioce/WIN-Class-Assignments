# OOP Assignment 

- Create an Animal class. Have it be the parent class for all the sub-classes that you will make. 
- Create 10 methods within the parent class that can extend to all the sub-classes. 
- Create sub-classes that correspond to the Animal class and that have appropriate methods to go down the chain. 
- Below are some examples of how the class structure will work: 

```
Example 1 - Tiger
Kingdom: Animalia (Animal)
Phylum: Chordata (Vertebrate)
Class: Mammalia (Mammal)
Order: Carnivora (Carnivore)
Family: Felidae (Cat)
Genus: Panthera
Species: Panthera tigris (Tiger)

Example 2 - Orang-utan
Kingdom: Animalia (Animal)
Phylum: Chordata (Vertebrate)
Class: Mammalia (Mammal)
Order: Primates
Family: Hominidae (Great Apes)
Genus: Pongo
Species: Pongo pygmaeus (Orang-Utan)
```

- You can use the Animal classification charts to help you on this journey. Please follow the KPCOFGS order of inheritance. 
- You need to create 10 different Species classes that all have Overridden methods that make them unique from the parent classes that they extend.
