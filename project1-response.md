#Project 1 Response

### The Project
We (Kyle, Michael, Bruice, and myself) created a react app that allowed the user to view 
a virtual bookshelf organized by genres. The user was able to mark whether they had read the 
book, and they also were able to edit data on the book and delete it. We provided an information
page for each book where the user could view detailed info on the book and read a summary
of the novel. The user was also able to add a book to one shelf, where they could include data on the 
book title,author,year,and genre.

### The Good
The styling for the page was on point, and there was a lot of good work done by Kyle and Bruice both in image creation/requisition and styling implementation. We also were able to create a (mostly) correct data flow between components and our component architecture was pretty good. Overall the app
looked really good and it worked well.

### The Bad
I was disappointed in my contribution to the project. I was definitely able to help with some of 
the more technical tasks and with some other parts of the project, but I am upset I wasn't able to 
include the dynamically created and populated shelves or keep our app persistant. I think we had a 
little bit of a hard time getting on the same page at the beginning at least codebase wise, and I think our workflow could be optimised, especially with using git. I think if we had like a 'git master', who understood the comprehensive view of the project and was in charge of creating and assigning branches for us to work on, as well as tasks, and who could control the merging of these things, that would be really helpful.

## Verdict
Overall I think it was a good learning experience and interesting and engaging. I would definitely like to do many more projects in the future and I liked working in a team very much.
