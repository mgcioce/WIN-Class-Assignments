// - Create a new project in your TTS directory titled antsGoMarching
// 	- add an index.html file
// 	- add a javascript file 
// 	- link the two files together
// - In your JS file paste the above code
// - there are several errors in this code sample 
// 	- use your debugger to track those errors down 
// - We've already given you a `debugger` statement to start with. 
// - Your finished output should be something like this:
